Tasks
=====

.. todo::

    Create a single location (section?) to where the following are defined:

    * position
    * turnover
    * stages/stage ("As noted (see 'stages') the term stage here encompasses reverse processing")

.. todo::

    Figure out how to deal with functions tat return Unicode in doctests.

.. todo::

    Explain non-mutability of `EnigmaConfig` and how stepping makes a *new* one.

.. todo::

    Ask about alternatives to ReadTheDocs (for autogenerated hosted docs) or a way to pick a theme there:
    the RTD theme is terrible.

.. todo::

    Resolve difference (if any) between *Walzenstellung* and *Grundstellung*; adjust `config_enigma` docs.

.. todo::

    Ask how to document list and optional returns and arguments (these don't render correctly).
    `List[]`, `list of ...`, `Optional[]`, `..., optional`

.. todo::

    Ask how to get `Yields` to render correctly.

.. todo::

    Review how to do terms/definitions systematically.

.. todo::

    Review "overview" sections: Remove? Remove `~` for full names?

.. todo::

    Add and link mathematical discussion and equivalences; e.g., formula for `~.components.Component.mapping` as:

    .. math::

        \mu_{i}(c)=\rho^{s_{i}(c)}\omega_{i}\rho^{-s_{i}(c)}
